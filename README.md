# Maze - _Can you get out?_
#### _Maze is a browser-based game created using pure `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`._<br><br>
The game is based on the concept of a rogue-like dungeon crawler game, where the viewport moves with the sprite, keeping the sprite always centered.<br><br>
* There are four levels, and each level is timed, with the _time-to-complete_ decreasing for higher levels in order to make the game challenging.
* The sprite and the map is made using rectangles, but proper game physics has been incorporated (for example, there is a subtle feedback when the sprite hits the walls).
